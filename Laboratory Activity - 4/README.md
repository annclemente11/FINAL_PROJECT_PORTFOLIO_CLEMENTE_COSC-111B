🔌 Laboratory Activity 4: Arduino Serial Connection
🧠 Overview

This introduces students to serial communication in Arduino—a critical feature that allows interaction between the microcontroller and a computer in real time. Through the use of the Serial Monitor, this activity demonstrates how sensor data and user commands can work together to control hardware behavior.

By combining sensor input, threshold logic, and text-based Serial commands, learners explore how embedded systems respond not only to environmental conditions but also to direct human input—an essential concept in debugging, monitoring, and interactive IoT systems.

🎯 Objectives
- Understand and implement Arduino Serial communication
- Explore and practice basic Serial functions in Arduino
- Create a simple circuit controlled through Serial commands

🛠️ Instructions
Using the diagram and code from Laboratory Activity 3, complete the following steps:

🔍 Sensor Selection

Select one sensor to use in this activity:
🌡️ Thermistor

💡 Photoresistor

🎚️ Threshold Configuration
- Set the threshold based on the selected sensor:
- Thermistor → 50 °C
- Photoresistor → 220

🧩 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Serial communication between Arduino and a computer
- Command-based hardware control
- Persistent state logic independent of sensor changes
- Loop-based execution with user interruption
