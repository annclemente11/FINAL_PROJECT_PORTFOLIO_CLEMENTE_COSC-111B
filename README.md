**Final-Project-Clemente-COSC111B**


This repository contains all laboratory activities and examinations for *COSC 111B – CS Elective 3 (Internet of Things)*. It demonstrates hands-on work with Arduino, Python, FastAPI, sensors, LEDs, and serial communication — progressing from basic digital output control to complete IoT-based systems.

### Repository Structure

*Final-Project-Serrona*

*Midterms*

    - Lab_Act_#1 – Digital signals and running light LEDs  
    - Lab_Act_#2 – Analog signals and PWM-based LED brightness control  
    - Lab_Act_#3 – Sensor-based fire detection using thermistor and LDR  
    - Lab_Act_#4 – Serial monitoring and control using photoresistor  
    - Midterms_Lab_Exam – Smart lighting system with manual and automatic modes  

*Finals*

    - Lab_Act_#5 – Python to Arduino serial LED control  
    - Lab_Act_#6 – Bidirectional Arduino–Python communication (button and LED control)  
    - Lab_Act_#7 – FastAPI and Arduino web-controlled LEDs  
    - Finals_Lab_Exam – Arduino-to-Python client triggering remote LED via API  

Each folder includes the necessary source code and supporting files for its respective activity.

***

### Common Files in Each Lab

    - main.ino – Main Arduino sketch for the activity  
    - main.py – Python script for serial or API interaction (when applicable)  
    - main_functions.h – Header file containing reusable Arduino functions  
    - breadboard_diagram.png – Wiring diagram or hardware schematic  

Not all labs contain every file listed above; only the relevant files are included per activity.

***

### Tools and Technologies

    - Arduino IDE for compiling and uploading sketches  
    - Python (with pyserial, requests, and FastAPI where applicable)  
    - Visual Studio Code or preferred text editor  
    - Basic electronic components: LEDs, resistors, push buttons, thermistor, photoresistor, breadboard, and jumper wires  

***

### Notes

    - Each lab is self-contained; files are designed to work only within their own folders.  
    - Activities are grouped into *Midterms* and *Finals* for easy course progression tracking.  
    - The repository showcases a learning portfolio that advances from basic Arduino input/output concepts to IoT-style systems integrated with web APIs.

### How to Use

    1. Open the desired lab folder.  
    2. For Arduino activities, open *main.ino* using the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port, then upload the sketch.  
    3. For Python-enabled activities, install the required dependencies and execute *main.py* from the corresponding folder.  
    4. Follow the provided *breadboard_diagram.png* (or equivalent) for proper hardware wiring.
